# GraphQL Full Course

The source code of this repository is taken from freeCodeCamp's [GraphQL Full Course - Novice to Expert](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ed8SzALpx1Q) video.

This is really a nice tutorial and it clears my understanding of GraphQL. Though I'm very big fan of Traversy Media, I would say this GraphQL tutorial is better than Traversy Media's tutorial, at least for me.

One thing to note here that I used functional components and hooks even though the original tutorial used class components.

This is really a nice tutorial and I would highly suggest to use this tutorial to clear one's understanding of GraphQL.
